## Installing

- install Atom: [atom.io](https://atom.io/)
- install the [dartg](https://atom.io/packages/dart) package

The plugin should auto-detect the Dart SDK location. If not, you can set it
manually in the plugin configuration page (`Preferences > Packages > dartlang`).

## Packages we recommend

`synced-sidebar` - this package synchronises the selection in the file view with
the active text editor.

## Packages to avoid

We do not recommend using both [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) and the
dartlang package together. Editing large .dart files will be slow if you have
emmet installed. You can track the issue
[here](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/issues/319).
